About this project:
  1. Maskgit is a two-stages image generation model (the first stage is to quantize an image to a sequence of discrete tokens. In the second stage, an autoregressive model is learned to generate image tokens sequentially based on the previously generated result.
  2. First stage (VQGAN) is trained on Celebrity Face Image Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishesh1412/celebrity-face-image-dataset) with minimal settings (image size: 32, depth: 3, latent dim: 64,...).
  3. Second stage (Transformer) has not trained yet because I don't have enough computational resources (Google Colab free tier).
