# MaskGIT - Masked Generative Image Transformer
MaskGIT is a two-stage image generation model. The first stage is to quantize an image to a sequence of discrete tokens. In the second stage, an autoregressive model is learned to generate image tokens sequentially based on the previously generated result.
# About this project:
1. This is a personal project, for educational purposes only!
2. Experiment:
2.1. The first stage (VQGAN):
     - Model size: ~17.9M params (image size: 32, depth: 3, latent dim: 64,...).
     - Dataset: [Celebrity Face Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishesh1412/celebrity-face-image-dataset)
     - Number of epochs: 200.
     - Platform: Google Colab free.
2.2. The second stage (Transformer):
     - Model size: 35.4M params.
     - Dataset: [Celebrity Face Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishesh1412/celebrity-face-image-dataset)
     - Number of epochs:
     - Platform: Google Colab free.
3. Result:
   - The reconstructed image is acceptable.

# How to use:
1. Clone this repo, cd to maskgit.
2. Install the requirements: pip install -q -r requirements.txt.
3. Traning the VQGAN: modify the config file (configs/vqgan.yaml), then run the below command:
```
 python train.py \
   --phase "vqgan" \
   --config_file "./configs/vqgan.yaml" \
   --max_epochs 10 \
   --ckpt_path "path/to/checkpoint" # when you want to resume training
```
5. Training the Transformer: modify the config file (configs/transformer.yaml, in this phase you must provide vqgan checkpoint path), then run the below command:
```
 python train.py \
   --phase "transformer" \
   --config_file "./configs/transformer.yaml" \
   --max_epochs 10 \
   --ckpt_path "path/to/checkpoint" # when you want to resume training
```
> The logs and checkpoints will be saved to the "results" folder. \
Note: This project was built on Google Colab, it may not work on other platforms.
